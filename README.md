## Project Overview
This repository focuses on Bluetooth Low Energy Angle of Departure (BLE AoD) for indoor localization. A remote-controlled car equipped with a Raspberry Pi navigates in a lab area fitted with BLE AoD antenna arrays. We aim to research BLE AoD accuracy and evaluate its performance.

## Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi**: Control unit for the vehicle
- **Nordic nRF52833 Development Kits**: BLE AoD transmitter and receiver
- **AN240207-01H Antenna Arrays**: BLE AoD antenna setup


## Evaluation & Outlook
- **Measurement**: Collect AoD-based position data and compute accuracy metrics (mean error, standard deviation)
- **Next Steps**: Compare results with UWB repo and explore hybrid approaches once both implementations are available.
